# Security Log Analyzer & Anomaly Detection Engine

A Python-based security log analysis tool designed to detect anomalous and potentially malicious behavior using statistical techniques and security-focused reasoning.

This project demonstrates practical skills in security analytics, log parsing, anomaly detection, and automation-oriented thinking.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Modern systems generate massive volumes of logs, making manual security monitoring inefficient and error-prone.  
This project aims to:

- Parse and normalize security-related logs
- Analyze behavioral patterns
- Detect anomalous activities that may indicate security threats
- Produce structured reports to support security decision-making

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Unlike simple log parsers, this project focuses on **security reasoning**, not just data extraction.

It simulates how a security engineer thinks:
- What is normal behavior?
- What deviation is suspicious?
- When should an alert or response be triggered?

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Basic statistical anomaly detection (Z-score / IQR)
- Structured log analysis (CSV / JSON)

---

## 📂 Project Structure


---

## 🔍 Core Features

- Log parsing using regular expressions
- Event normalization into structured formats
- Behavioral analysis per IP/user
- Statistical anomaly detection
- Classification of suspicious activities (e.g., brute-force attempts)
- JSON-based reporting for security insights

---

## 📊 Example Use Case

- Analyze authentication logs
- Detect unusually high login failure rates from a single IP
- Flag the activity as potential brute-force behavior
- Generate a structured anomaly report

---

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is under active development.  
Initial focus is on log parsing and anomaly detection logic, with future enhancements planned.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Support for additional log types (web, firewall, cloud)
- Threshold tuning and adaptive baselines
- Integration with alerting or response mechanisms
- Visualization of detected anomalies

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project uses **synthetic or sample log data only**.  
No real or sensitive production logs are included.
