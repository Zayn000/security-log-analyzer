# Security Log Analyzer & Anomaly Detection Engine

A Python-based security log analysis tool designed to detect anomalous and potentially malicious behavior using statistical techniques and security-focused reasoning.

This project demonstrates practical skills in security analytics, log parsing, anomaly detection, and automation-oriented thinking.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Modern systems generate massive volumes of logs, making manual security monitoring inefficient and error-prone.  
This project aims to:

- Parse and normalize security-related logs
- Analyze behavioral patterns
- Detect anomalous activities that may indicate security threats
- Produce structured reports to support security decision-making

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Unlike simple log parsers, this project focuses on **security reasoning**, not just data extraction.

It simulates how a security engineer thinks:
- What is normal behavior?
- What deviation is suspicious?
- When should an alert or response be triggered?

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Basic statistical anomaly detection (Z-score / IQR)
- Structured log analysis (CSV / JSON)
